# Initial thoughts
## What is the challenge?
- Develop and implement an algorithm that solves a given sliding puzzle
- Ensure a solution to the sliding puzzle is shown if one exists, else give a "no solution message"
- Allow for solving of a 2x3 and 3x3 dimension puzzle (at least)
- Ensure algorithm is efficient
- Implement a graphically appealing GUI

## Programming language: Java or Python?
- For this project I shall be using Java in order to make use of the JSwing form editor for a good looking GUI.
- I am also most confident in Java and given the short time-frame for this project, it would be best if I code in my most-fluent language.

## The game
- The sliding puzzle game is a 2D game in which there is a board with dimensions n x m (2x3 or 3x3).
- The board contains (n*m)-1 tiles, leaving 1 space for tiles to move.
- Tiles can only move into the space as they cannot overlap, meaning only tiles within 1 tile of the space on the x or y coordinate can move in either the x or y coordinate.
- The aim of the game is to get all of the tiles in their correct positions to match an end goal.
